# Introduction

MuShop is a microservices demo application **purpose-built** to showcase
interoperable [Cloud Native](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/) services on
[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/).

The premise of MuShop is an e-commerce website offering a variety of cat
products. It represents a polyglot microservice application, with **actual use case**
scenarios for many Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.

> Each microservice in MuShop is designed to highlight its own, or common high-level
subject in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, while keeping context of the demo application.

- Build and deploy microservices with [Container Engine for Kubernetes](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/container-engine-kubernetes.html) (OKE)
- Experience Oracle Cloud services integrated into a single project
- Provide reference implementations and sample code for real-world development
